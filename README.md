# Prediction And Falsification Protocols From Finite-Capacity Causal Networks

This repository is the isolated Paper 15 workspace for the finite-capacity
emergent-spacetime program.

Paper 15 target:

> Starting from the closed Paper 14 conditional discriminating benchmarks
> theorem, formulate finite network-native prediction and falsification
> protocol structure while preserving finite capacity, locality, bounded
> transfer, causal-cone/no-signaling constraints, comparison stability,
> conservation/coarse-graining stability, evidence manifest stability,
> reproduction protocol compatibility, validation readout stability,
> promotion-gate compatibility, evidence-intake compatibility, benchmark
> compatibility, and compatibility with the upstream geometry, curvature,
> dynamics, quantum-compatible local dynamics, matter/gauge observable,
> particle-excitation observable, Standard-Model-candidate observable,
> observed-catalog comparison observable, external evidence manifest, external
> validation readout, physical-promotion gate, external physical evidence
> intake, and discriminating benchmark packages.

The current theorem package is open and non-promoting. `PFP-001` records the
upstream binding and claim boundary through the closed Paper 14 result.
`PFP-002` defines finite prediction-and-falsification protocol records as
bounded, auditable, non-promoting interface rows. `PFP-003` defines finite
prediction target, observable, and regime descriptors. `PFP-004` defines
finite falsification threshold and rejection-condition descriptors. `PFP-005`
is the active next obligation: define Paper 14 benchmark compatibility without
benchmark, prediction, or falsification success.

This does not prove protocol recovery, benchmark success, prediction success,
falsification success, physical promotion, physical validation, empirical
adequacy, observed particle catalog recovery, physical Standard Model content,
physical particle excitations, physical matter fields, physical gauge fields,
physical quantum dynamics, continuum quantum field theory, simulation-only
promotion, fit-only calibration, physical nature realization, or a unified
field theory.

Persistent boundary tokens: protocol recovery; benchmark success; prediction
success; falsification success; physical promotion; physical validation;
empirical adequacy; observed particle catalog recovery; physical Standard
Model content; physical particle excitations; physical quantum dynamics;
continuum quantum field theory; simulation-only promotion; fit-only
calibration; physical nature promotion; unified-field promotion.
